&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a college freshman and you&#39;re choosing a major. You&#39;re

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
debating between Nursing and Geography. So, you decide that you&#39;re going to look

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
at how much Nursing majors make as opposed to Geography majors. Fortunately,

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
these days, data is often easily accessible. You find that the frequency

6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:21
distributions of Nursing majors&#39; salaries and Geography majors&#39; salaries looks

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
like this. So, let&#39;s say that these histograms were created from the data from

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
everyone who either majored in Nursing or Geography, and the x-axis represents

9
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
their annual income in thousands. From these distributions, approximately what

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
income do most Nursing majors make, and approximately what income do most

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
Geography majors make?
