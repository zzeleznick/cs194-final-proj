1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,68
The President: Good evening.

2
00:00:02,68 --> 00:00:04,838
On Wednesday, 14 Americans
were killed as they came

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,439
together to celebrate
the holidays.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,442
They were taken from family
and friends

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,177
who loved them deeply.

6
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,13
They were white and
black; Latino and Asian;

7
00:00:14,13 --> 00:00:16,916
immigrants and
American-born;

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,787
moms and dads;
daughters and sons.

9
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,957
Each of them served their
fellow citizens and all of

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,427
them were part of
our American family.

11
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,363
Tonight, I want to talk
with you about this tragedy,

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,365
the broader threat
of terrorism,

13
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,969
and how we can keep
our country safe.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,37
The FBI is still gathering
the facts about what

15
00:00:38,37 --> 00:00:40,473
happened in San Bernardino,
but here is what we know.

16
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,376
The victims were brutally
murdered and injured by one

17
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,213
of their coworkers
and his wife.

18
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,482
So far, we have no evidence
that the killers were

19
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,385
directed by a terrorist
organization overseas,

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,489
or that they were part of a
broader conspiracy here at home.

21
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,592
But it is clear that the two
of them had gone down the

22
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,29
dark path of radicalization,
embracing a perverted

23
00:01:03,29 --> 00:01:05,398
interpretation of Islam
that calls for war

24
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,399
against America and the West.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,804
They had stockpiled assault
weapons, ammunition,

26
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,472
and pipe bombs.

27
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,973
So this was an
act of terrorism,

28
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,578
designed to kill
innocent people.

29
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,114
Our nation has been at war
with terrorists since al

30
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,418
Qaeda killed nearly
3,000 Americans on 9/11.

31
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,420
In the process, we've
hardened our defenses --

32
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,756
from airports to
financial centers,

33
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,559
to other critical
infrastructure.

34
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,128
Intelligence and law
enforcement agencies have

35
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,298
disrupted countless
plots here and overseas,

36
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,968
and worked around the
clock to keep us safe.

37
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,970
Our military and
counterterrorism

38
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,972
professionals have
relentlessly pursued

39
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,375
terrorist networks overseas
-- disrupting safe havens in

40
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,245
several different countries,
killing Osama bin Laden,

41
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:55,248
and decimating al
Qaeda's leadership.

42
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:58,685
Over the last few
years, however,

43
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:02,622
the terrorist threat has
evolved into a new phase.

44
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,124
As we've become better
at preventing complex,

45
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:08,495
multifaceted
attacks like 9/11,

46
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,598
terrorists turned to less
complicated acts of violence

47
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,33
like the mass shootings that
are all too common

48
00:02:14,33 --> 00:02:16,469
in our society.

49
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,138
It is this type of attack
that we saw at Fort Hood in

50
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,408
2009; in Chattanooga
earlier this year;

51
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:25,945
and now in San Bernardino.

52
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,549
And as groups like ISIL grew
stronger amidst the chaos of

53
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,520
war in Iraq and then Syria,
and as the Internet erases

54
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,154
the distance
between countries,

55
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:38,458
we see growing efforts by
terrorists to poison the

56
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,395
minds of people like the
Boston Marathon bombers and

57
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,696
the San Bernardino killers.

58
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:48,201
For seven years, I've
confronted this evolving

59
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,170
threat each morning in
my intelligence briefing.

60
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,474
And since the day
I took this office,

61
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,209
I've authorized U.S. forces

62
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,145
to take out
terrorists abroad precisely

63
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,782
because I know how
real the danger is.

64
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,784
As Commander-in-Chief,
I have no greater

65
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,987
responsibility than the
security of the American people.

66
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,623
As a father to two young
daughters who are the most

67
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:14,626
precious part of my life, I
know that we see ourselves

68
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,63
with friends and coworkers
at a holiday party like the

69
00:03:17,63 --> 00:03:19,197
one in San Bernardino.

70
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,634
I know we see our kids
in the faces of the young

71
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,3
people killed in Paris.

72
00:03:24,3 --> 00:03:26,471
And I know that
after so much war,

73
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,275
many Americans are asking
whether we are confronted by

74
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,744
a cancer that has
no immediate cure.

75
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:37,216
Well, here's what I want
you to know: The threat from

76
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:41,187
terrorism is real, but
we will overcome it.

77
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,23
We will destroy ISIL and
any other organization

78
00:03:44,23 --> 00:03:46,359
that tries to harm us.

79
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,528
Our success won't
depend on tough talk,

80
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,165
or abandoning our values,
or giving into fear.

81
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,635
That's what groups like
ISIL are hoping for.

82
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:59,772
Instead, we will prevail
by being strong and smart,

83
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,775
resilient and relentless,
and by drawing upon every

84
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,746
aspect of American power.

85
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,248
Here's how.

86
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,185
First, our military will
continue to hunt down

87
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,253
terrorist plotters in
any country

88
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,656
where it is necessary.

89
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,692
In Iraq and Syria,
airstrikes are taking out

90
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:24,130
ISIL leaders, heavy weapons,
oil tankers, infrastructure.

91
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,431
And since the
attacks in Paris,

92
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,167
our closest allies --
including France, Germany,

93
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,436
and the United Kingdom
-- have ramped up their

94
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,72
contributions to our
military campaign,

95
00:04:33,72 --> 00:04:35,108
which will help us
accelerate our effort

96
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,977
to destroy ISIL.

97
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,513
Second, we will continue
to provide training and

98
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,849
equipment to tens of
thousands of Iraqi and

99
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,252
Syrian forces fighting ISIL
on the ground so that we

100
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,453
take away their safe havens.

101
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,857
In both countries, we're
deploying Special Operations

102
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:54,93
Forces who can accelerate
that offensive.

103
00:04:54,93 --> 00:04:56,496
We've stepped up this effort
since the attacks in Paris,

104
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,232
and we'll continue to invest
more in approaches that are

105
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,301
working on the ground.

106
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:05,138
Third, we're working with
friends and allies to stop

107
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,907
ISIL's operations
-- to disrupt plots,

108
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,842
cut off their financing, and
prevent them from recruiting

109
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,512
more fighters.

110
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,514
Since the attacks in
Paris, we've surged

111
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,383
intelligence-sharing
with our European allies.

112
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,53
We're working with Turkey to
seal its border with Syria.

113
00:05:20,53 --> 00:05:24,223
And we are cooperating with
Muslim-majority countries --

114
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,26
and with our Muslim
communities here at home --

115
00:05:27,26 --> 00:05:29,262
to counter the vicious
ideology that ISIL

116
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,198
promotes online.

117
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,900
Fourth, with
American leadership,

118
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,237
the international community
has begun to establish a

119
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,575
process -- and timeline --
to pursue ceasefires and a

120
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,844
political resolution
to the Syrian war.

121
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,281
Doing so will allow the
Syrian people and every

122
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,16
country, including
our allies,

123
00:05:50,16 --> 00:05:51,884
but also countries
like Russia,

124
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:55,455
to focus on the common goal
of destroying ISIL -- a

125
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,457
group that threatens us all.

126
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,994
This is our strategy
to destroy ISIL.

127
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,897
It is designed and supported
by our military commanders

128
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,233
and counterterrorism
experts,

129
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,669
together with 65 countries
that have joined an

130
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,270
American-led coalition.

131
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,241
And we constantly examine
our strategy to determine

132
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,777
when additional steps are
needed to get the job done.

133
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,780
That's why I've ordered the
Departments of State and

134
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,782
Homeland Security to review
the visa *Waiver program

135
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,786
under which the female
terrorist in San Bernardino

136
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,88
originally came
to this country.

137
00:06:29,88 --> 00:06:31,724
And that's why I will
urge high-tech and law

138
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,694
enforcement leaders to make
it harder for terrorists to

139
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,296
use technology to
escape from justice.

140
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:43,436
Now, here at home, we have
to work together to address

141
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,436
the challenge.

142
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,572
There are several steps that
Congress should

143
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,641
take right away.

144
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,344
To begin with, Congress
should act to make sure no

145
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,815
one on a no-fly list
is able to buy a gun.

146
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,351
What could possibly be the
argument for allowing a

147
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,87
terrorist suspect to buy
a semi-automatic weapon?

148
00:07:01,87 --> 00:07:05,491
This is a matter of
national security.

149
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,493
We also need to make it
harder for people to buy

150
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,163
powerful assault weapons
like the ones that were used

151
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,164
in San Bernardino.

152
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,866
I know there are some
who reject

153
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,568
any gun safety measures.

154
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,703
But the fact is that
our intelligence and law

155
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,772
enforcement agencies -- no
matter how effective they

156
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,144
are -- cannot identify
every would-be mass shooter,

157
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,114
whether that individual is
motivated by ISIL or some

158
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,515
other hateful ideology.

159
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,287
What we can do -- and must
do -- is make it harder

160
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,289
for them to kill.

161
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,592
Next, we should put in place
stronger screening for those

162
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,863
who come to America without
a visa so that we can take a

163
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:47,33
hard look at whether they've
traveled to warzones.

164
00:07:47,33 --> 00:07:49,35
And we're working with
members of both parties in

165
00:07:49,35 --> 00:07:51,537
Congress to do exactly that.

166
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,941
Finally, if Congress
believes, as I do,

167
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:57,275
that we are at
war with ISIL,

168
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,12
it should go ahead and vote
to authorize the continued

169
00:08:00,12 --> 00:08:03,816
use of military force
against these terrorists.

170
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,419
For over a year, I have
ordered our military to take

171
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,788
thousands of airstrikes
against ISIL targets.

172
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,324
I think it's time for
Congress to vote to

173
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,793
demonstrate that the
American people are united,

174
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,795
and committed,
to this fight.

175
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,600
My fellow Americans, these
are the steps that we can

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,637
take together to defeat
the terrorist threat.

177
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,306
Let me now say a word about
what we should not do.

178
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,212
We should not be drawn once
more into a long and costly

179
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,982
ground war in Iraq or Syria.

180
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:39,818
That's what groups
like ISIL want.

181
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,889
They know they can't defeat
us on the battlefield.

182
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,358
ISIL fighters were part of
the insurgency that we faced

183
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
in Iraq.

184
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,428
But they also know that if
we occupy foreign lands,

185
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,765
they can maintain
insurgencies for years,

186
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,734
killing thousands
of our troops,

187
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,870
draining our resources, and
using our presence to draw

188
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,439
new recruits.

189
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,809
The strategy that we are
using now -- airstrikes,

190
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,12
Special Forces, and working
with local forces who are

191
00:09:07,13 --> 00:09:10,683
fighting to regain control
of their own country -- that

192
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,86
is how we'll achieve a
more sustainable victory.

193
00:09:14,86 --> 00:09:17,89
And it won't require us
sending a new generation of

194
00:09:17,89 --> 00:09:20,693
Americans overseas to fight
and die for another decade

195
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,694
on foreign soil.

196
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,332
Here's what else
we cannot do.

197
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,635
We cannot turn against one
another by letting this

198
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:35,174
fight be defined as a war
between America and Islam.

199
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:39,111
That, too, is what
groups like ISIL want.

200
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,814
ISIL does not
speak for Islam.

201
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:46,185
They are thugs and killers,
part of a cult of death,

202
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:50,256
and they account for a tiny
fraction of more than a

203
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,326
billion Muslims around the
world -- including millions

204
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,861
of patriotic Muslim
Americans who reject

205
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,731
their hateful ideology.

206
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,200
Moreover, the vast majority
of terrorist victims around

207
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,936
the world are Muslim.

208
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,573
If we're to succeed in
defeating terrorism we must

209
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,276
enlist Muslim communities
as some of our strongest

210
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:14,246
allies, rather than push
them away through suspicion

211
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,247
and hate.

212
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,986
That does not mean denying
the fact that an extremist

213
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,788
ideology has spread within
some Muslim communities.

214
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,425
This is a real problem
that Muslims must confront,

215
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,560
without excuse.

216
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,197
Muslim leaders here and
around the globe have to

217
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,934
continue working with us to
decisively and unequivocally

218
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,270
reject the hateful ideology
that groups like ISIL and al

219
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,308
Qaeda promote; to speak out
against not just acts of

220
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,144
violence, but also those
interpretations of Islam

221
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,646
that are incompatible with
the values of religious

222
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,683
tolerance, mutual respect,
and human dignity.

223
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,987
But just as it is the
responsibility of Muslims

224
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,89
around the world to root out
misguided ideas that lead to

225
00:10:58,90 --> 00:11:01,494
radicalization, it is
the responsibility of all

226
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,831
Americans -- of every faith
-- to reject discrimination.

227
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:10,369
It is our responsibility to
reject religious tests on

228
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,772
who we admit into
this country.

229
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,541
It's our responsibility to
reject proposals that Muslim

230
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,245
Americans should somehow
be treated differently.

231
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,315
Because when we travel
down that road, we lose.

232
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:27,920
That kind of divisiveness,
that betrayal of our values

233
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,21
plays into the hands
of groups like ISIL.

234
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,262
Muslim Americans are our
friends and our neighbors,

235
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:40,766
our co-workers, our
sports heroes -- and, yes,

236
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,636
they are our men and women
in uniform who are willing

237
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,206
to die in defense
of our country.

238
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,208
We have to remember that.

239
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,146
My fellow Americans, I am
confident we will succeed in

240
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,649
this mission because we
are on the right side

241
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,918
of history.

242
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,655
We were founded upon a
belief in human dignity --

243
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,990
that no matter who you are,
or where you come from,

244
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,494
or what you look like, or
what religion you practice,

245
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,897
you are equal in the eyes of
God and equal in the eyes

246
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,200
of the law.

247
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,68
Even in this
political season,

248
00:12:16,68 --> 00:12:18,971
even as we properly debate
what steps I and future

249
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:23,175
Presidents must take to
keep our country safe,

250
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,944
let's make sure we never
forget

251
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,180
what makes us exceptional.

252
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,83
Let's not forget that
freedom is more powerful

253
00:12:31,83 --> 00:12:34,954
than fear; that we have
always met challenges --

254
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:38,357
whether war or depression,
natural disasters or

255
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,528
terrorist attacks -- by
coming together around our

256
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:47,766
common ideals as one
nation, as one people.

257
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,2
So long as we stay
true to that tradition,

258
00:12:51,3 --> 00:12:55,274
I have no doubt
America will prevail.

259
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,275
Thank you.

260
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
God bless you,

261
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,277
and may God bless the United States of America.
