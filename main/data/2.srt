1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
joining us now republican presidential
candidate Donald Trump Donald how are

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,289
you this morning good morning but you
have to get the facts correct also

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,240
because in Sarasota is at five thousand
people and you can check this very

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,869
carefully because it was announced by
the Government 2,000 people not fighting

5
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:23,740
style than 12,000 12,000 people it was
announced by the convention center and

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,890
by government not by me and it was
twelve thousand so I want to get our

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,260
facts straight making yeah I don't we
have a lot to get through we got a lot

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,550
of people want to get through things
let's start with willie Geist a a a

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,419
jersey wrap dress made of networks is
keeping up with you not get your facts

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,270
right now

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,899
thousand-odd 5,000 willie yeah we can't
afford to have you asked a question at

12
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,239
this point make it down let me ask you
first

13
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:52,879
John McCain we just had him on a little
earlier yesterday he was asked about

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,370
some of your rhetoric some of the things
you said about Muslim Americans

15
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,339
including the question of the time
celebrating in Jersey City and he said

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,100
this has the effect of turning Muslims
all over the world against the United

17
00:01:04,99 --> 00:01:09,679
States of America which is 99.4% people
who practice and honorable religion

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,320
other people have said that as well as
John McCain have a point I don't think

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,830
he has a point because I would say that
we are not exactly loved by many Muslims

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,330
and whether it's 10% like you said on
the show this morning or whether it's a

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,908
much larger percent you saw the soccer
game the other day with a we're giving

22
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,369
me a minute of silence I assume you saw
that where the stadium burst out talking

23
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:38,460
about and shouting out things that even
the soccer players were very embarrassed

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,649
nobody knew what to do if they were
doing Muslim chance and that was a week

25
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,240
ago or less than a week ago that was
right after the tragedy in paris they

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,460
were honoring within a minute of silence
and it was not a pretty picture so I

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,270
think John McCain is incorrect I think
we have to be strong I think we have to

28
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,579
be vigilant that many Muslim friends are
wonderful people but we nevertheless we

29
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,699
have to be extremely vigilant and
extremely strong and we have to

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,580
understand what the problem is I don't
think John McCain probably does

31
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,100
understand the problem

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,920
we're talking about a match the soccer
match in in turkey there are well over a

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,500
billion Muslims we don't paint entire
religion based on the the chance of a

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,30
few people in a sign of you get a lot of
people a lot of people that soccer game

35
00:02:29,30 --> 00:02:33,270
we're going wild with their chanting and
everybody was very embarrassed we're not

36
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,490
talking about a few people gym what's
the purpose of all of this Aug you were

37
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,880
talking about people have to know the
problem is the fact you said the people

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,840
went wild after 911 muslims what wild
all over the world after 911 did you can

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,980
look at whether it's even a Ron R you
look at just about every muslim

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,980
government in the world

41
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,829
palestinians they they were holding
candlelight vigils holding prayer

42
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,530
services everybody but there are large
percentage of people that as you said

43
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,810
went wild and were celebrating all over
the world and I i order you don't

44
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,620
recognize it then we're never going to
solve the problem but there were a large

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,340
number of people that celebrated the
downing of the world

46
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,410
it keeps getting brought up I mean I'm
not bring it to you bring it is but it

47
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,560
keeps getting brought up but you know
you could go back to use to last weekend

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,350
the soccer game during that one minute
of silence in honor of the people that

49
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,519
were absolutely slaughtered disgustingly
slaughtered in that horrible thing that

50
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,560
took place in Paris and you see what
happened during that one better

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:54,440
as we as as we have so many issues to
talk about why is that important to you

52
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,410
why you bring that up and rallies why is
that right why should that be relevant

53
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,829
to voters who've been about night with
new hampshire well it is important

54
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,709
because you have to know the problems
but as far because we don't know the

55
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,590
process we have a president that won't
even mention deter more than Amy's if I

56
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,599
don't know what his problem is nobody
understands it he won't mention radical

57
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,99
Islamic terrorism he won't mention it he
you know it could be from a different

58
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,000
planet as far as he's concerned you're
not going to solve the problem unless

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,780
you're willing to talk about what the
problem is I'm willing to talk about

60
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,239
what the problem is that I do checked
out nice guy and you know he goes a

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,60
little bit wild on the show which you
know hopefully he did very well in the

62
00:04:34,60 --> 00:04:38,370
ratings are sure he did actually but he
goes overboard while he brings it up you

63
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,610
bring it up this morning I didn't bring
it up you bring it up this morning but

64
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,169
we have to know what the problem is
before we could solve the problems and

65
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,760
these are people that don't even know
what the problem is and they don't want

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,370
to admit what the problem is because
it's not politically correct to admit

67
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,50
what the problem is Joe where you know
and I as I thought you make it that is a

68
00:04:57,50 --> 00:05:01,30
fair point we are the ones that are
asking and chuck is the one that's what

69
00:05:01,30 --> 00:05:07,200
it's come up in your speeches and I i
guess i would start by asking at this

70
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,770
week how would you characterize most
Muslim Americans how would you

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:20,440
characterize people are so many people
make it so many many friends within the

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,900
Muslim American community and within the
Muslim community community we have some

73
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,20
very radical people who want to do great
harm to you and to cure and to everybody

74
00:05:33,20 --> 00:05:39,120
on your panel and to me and to this
country and the world now we can change

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,980
that doesn't exist and everybody will be
very happy or two

76
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,140
but it does exist wonderful people I
know so many of them and by the way the

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,260
1901 agree with me they say there is a
radical group of people that is doing

78
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,460
great harm and doing great harm to them
because they get tainted by what's going

79
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:08,239
on I think that sort of constant beating
of saying that this video of this

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,190
celebration exists when it's really in
question Donald is just it's gonna have

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,870
a negative impact on let's let's put it
to rest here's a story

82
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,260
number one take a look at the washington
post the other guy tried to pull back in

83
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,730
the store and by the way was the guy I
don't know why we need a supposedly he

84
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,970
interviewed me maybe even a couple of
times 35 years ago in the eighties

85
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,740
thirty-five years ago and then all of a
sudden you know I knew him I don't know

86
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,590
some reporters covering me yesterday I
see their name I see their byline I

87
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,260
don't even know what they look like that
supposedly he did you'd be in the

88
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,599
eighties I'm sure it's probably true I
mean it's possibly to but I've been

89
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,490
interviewed by thousands and thousands
of people were talking about 35 years

90
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,140
ago I don't know the guy but if you if
you don't address the problem and if you

91
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,80
don't know what the problem is you never
going to solve the problem

92
00:07:04,80 --> 00:07:09,890
this world has a big problem and we have
a president that doesn't even want to

93
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:15,99
call it by its correct name and we have
to get with it very simple I would say

94
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,590
John hellman donald I would just say
that thats you can talk about that and I

95
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:28,690
think that's a potential about the level
of hatred within a certain community in

96
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,120
this case the Muslim community there's a
level of hatred that people don't want

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,330
to talk about

98
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:54,580
do you believe it is a small small
percent 10% 10% 10% but maybe 10% 72

99
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,469
percent is a lot to talk about the kind
of destruction they want to do the way

100
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,159
for those that work with us at the 6
o'clock hour there's a gallon poly thing

101
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:13,120
from 708 that said 7% 8% of Muslims
across the world thought the 911 attacks

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,190
were completely justified this question
a way that we like to ask it on that we

103
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,610
have our pollsters asked this question
and I asked you to use them as a better

104
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,000
as a potential hasbro's educated do you
think that Islam is inherently peaceful

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,960
religion that's been by some small
percentages you said whatever the

106
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,49
percentages perverted by some or do you
think that Islam is inherently violent

107
00:08:35,49 --> 00:08:42,10
religion is something going on this
thing definitely going on I don't know

108
00:08:42,10 --> 00:08:46,209
that that question can be answered could
be injured two ways it could be ensured

109
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,420
both ways but there's something going on
there there's something that is a lot of

110
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,949
hatred coming out of at least a big part
of it we see that we did you see whether

111
00:08:56,949 --> 00:09:03,240
it's in Paris or whether it's the World
Trade Center or whether it's even a

112
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,100
soccer game out of respect for the
people that died in there was no respect

113
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,130
by a pretty good group of people in that
stadium and it was a week ago a week ago

114
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:20,110
something nasty coming out of there you
could answer it anyway you want but at

115
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,300
least we have to know the problem let's
get a rich get richer us though most

116
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,120
Americans would they not agree with

117
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,990
what Donald saying right now about even
if it's a small percentage it's a danger

118
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:42,550
and that's why I was saying the press
can fight Donald at the end of the day I

119
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,810
think it ends up helping him in
primaries yet I'm worried about the

120
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,560
ramifications of the conversation gets
too ugly and has I don't worry about it

121
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,279
and I don't help you I'll be honest I'm
not looking to do this for my whether I

122
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,930
win whether I lose about doing this or
that I'm doing it because somebody has

123
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,680
to bring it to the floor and nobody does
it and we have a leader's incompetent

124
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,20
and he doesn't do it but he doesn't want
to do it and he refuses to use the name

125
00:10:10,20 --> 00:10:15,470
and it's almost like what you have to do
what has to be done to have him finally

126
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,630
the words he should be ordering to talk
about what the real problem is she won't

127
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,730
do it in a lot of people that are going
to support Donald Trump and other

128
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:32,210
republicans do wonder why he won't call
Islamic radicalism and extremism Islamic

129
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,690
radicalism or extremism why won't he do
that he can't speak for itself my senses

130
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,110
that he wants to keep the up position on
the religion she doesn't want to frame

131
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,320
it as a religious issue wants to keep
the focus on terrorists are radicals

132
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
whatever doesn't want to do a broader
problem that Islamic extremism

133
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,709
radicalism there is Islamic extremism
and I actually think what Donald Trump

134
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:56,569
said there is even a small percentage
could cause real mayhem as we saw in

135
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,100
Paris only a few people with the right
way can cause mayhem in an open

136
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,470
democratic society so even if we're
phenomenally successful in 99.9% of

137
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,200
people on the right tribal or even small
numbers can cause real damage

138
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,89
stitched up to 47 s fewer pressure right
now when you were over in Paris what is

139
00:11:15,89 --> 00:11:18,380
it you would be trying to do on climate
change and what it is what is it you

140
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,680
would be trying to prevent if you were
leading the America United States at the

141
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,890
conference

142
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,949
well first of all one of the dumbest
statements have ever heard in politics

143
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,310
history of politics as I know it which
is pretty good

144
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:38,670
was Obama's statement that our number
one problem is global warming

145
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,750
when we have large groups of people
don't want to blow up every one of our

146
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,20
cities that want to destroy our country
that want to kill our people he's

147
00:11:48,20 --> 00:11:51,319
worried about global warming I think
it's one of the dumbest things I've ever

148
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,750
seen or perhaps most naive he could be
naive in a certain way he actually

149
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,980
actually i think is somewhat naive if
you want to know the truth beyond

150
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,250
incompetent part I think his statement
the other day that we're going to show

151
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,200
them when we meet we mean business for
the future global warming and climate

152
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,530
change or whatever the new term is
because now they have extreme weather

153
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,310
you know that somebody new terms because
the old one still works very well you

154
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,50
know it used to be global warming and
then had a problem with it had some very

155
00:12:23,50 --> 00:12:27,699
cool areas and that wasn't working so
you know they go climate change now it's

156
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,470
extreme weather so I don't know which
one of the many terms he used all

157
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,780
supposedly meaning the same thing for
him to say that that's more important

158
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:42,400
than shopping countries like by the way
north korea which is never even

159
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,240
mentioned you know they made one of the
worst deals in history when the media

160
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,880
randall but probably doesn't have to
clear weapons right now what about North

161
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,730
Korea nobody mentioned said that's like
when you have something to do don't want

162
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,760
to do you don't mention it because you
don't want to do it you don't want to

163
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,430
talk about it so sad and what's your
plan on climate change what would you be

164
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:12,540
saying it so that's what my take on
climate changes we wanted to have clean

165
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,610
air to breathe and we would have
beautiful clean water that's very

166
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,610
important to me

167
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,850
cleaning and environmental issues

168
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,560
something that our people don't know
this about me but many many projects all

169
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,459
over the world and I have received many
environmental awards you know the

170
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,200
environmentalists say two seasons awards
because it really does it but I receive

171
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,810
some of the house

172
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:39,569
awards and many of them for the work
I've done some of it I guess but you

173
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,730
know many of them and to be honest with
you you know I think it's very important

174
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,120
if you developing if you're building a
few factories remember this will

175
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,510
practically not allowed to use told him
or what do we do with our coalition

176
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:58,10
between China and they should be within
the arab chinese getting out there and

177
00:13:58,10 --> 00:14:05,580
doing it well we have a planet and its a
certain size whether its arse putting it

178
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,260
into the year China when you get up to
its all the same thing so they're not

179
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,439
behaving at all never do and the way
they produced a good specialist

180
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,570
expensively cuz they don't have all the
rules regulations and having to do with

181
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,830
clean air and other things and many
other things by the way you look at what

182
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,970
happens with with charcoal we don't use
it

183
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,560
the industries in shatters but what does
get use is being shipped to China and

184
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,189
interviewing it into the year so you
know if you talking about global warming

185
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,680
or climate change

186
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,829
you have to make the world BAQ catches
behaving become non-competitive because

187
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,550
we're behaving other countries like
China and Vietnam and many others are

188
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,430
not behaving with the washington post is
with us thats question robert i Robert

189
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,260
good morning mr. Trump later today
you're going to be meeting with a group

190
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,460
of african-american pastors at Trump
Tower I would like to know what your

191
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,350
view is your message to them on two key
issues the black lives matter movement

192
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:14,460
in the unrest that race happened they
wanted to be that had meetings with the

193
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,150
before I have a great relationship I
have a great relationship with with many

194
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,890
of them and do want to me and I think it
was great and I was told it was in there

195
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,160
was fire whether it is or not that's
fine I think the meeting is a good thing

196
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,140
anyway

197
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,819
and there were quite a few days ago what
happened probably gets publicity

198
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,430
unfortunately is everything I do get
publicity and probably some of the black

199
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,449
lives matter folks grow them up sale you
shouldn't be meeting with dropped

200
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,600
because he believes it arrives better I
believe black lights to matter but I

201
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,310
believe our lives better

202
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,369
very strongly about like with the
character that's running running against

203
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,600
two people that I really believe it or
lose big league hillary and birdie and

204
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,200
he talked about like I was better than
he goes amigos it to a show in the

205
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,530
club's record black prizefighter black
last night he was he was a disgrace to

206
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,270
what I think happened is a lot of
pressure was put on it but I'm gonna

207
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,110
have a meeting I have no idea what the
meeting is really you know I'm going to

208
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,310
a meeting I have a great relationship
with the black pastors I've had I know

209
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,79
many of them will see what happens I
don't know if its endorsement I don't

210
00:16:21,80 --> 00:16:24,480
know if it's a dude or swing by some I
think probably would be an endorsement

211
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,620
by some fantastic relationships with the
people but I do think that pressure was

212
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,560
put on them when they're there was a
beating by people that maybe disagree

213
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,510
with certain let's let's let's get some
other topics he really quickly

214
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,640
couple people that have moved up in the
polls and are now vying for second place

215
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,710
crews and the Rubio do you think Ted
Cruz is qualified to be President United

216
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,800
States with a good president yeah I do
think he's qualified I do think he would

217
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,520
be qualified to be absolutely what about
Marco Rubio I think so these are young

218
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:04,530
he's got a bad voting record in Florida
but he's got a week record on borders if

219
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,720
you look at broader security if you
don't get illegal immigration for a

220
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,60
weekend at its Ramon amnesty which
bothers me about it but he's a nice guy

221
00:17:12,60 --> 00:17:18,649
I've gotten into him during the campaign
I like him and I think he would have a

222
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,170
shot so critical that were showing up
all right now that has you wanna be a

223
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:30,780
goal in the first place cruz second cars
and third Rubio fourth let me ask first

224
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,10
place every single state and every
single day

225
00:17:33,10 --> 00:17:40,600
national polls do you think that is the
case I don't know I don't know group is

226
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:49,120
going to bypass the same more on
supposition that refines we need is just

227
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,639
showing joyfully say and jokingly say
dropped his picked up that point so we

228
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,970
talked about Marco Rubio supporting
amnesty you don't say bad things about

229
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,330
Ted Cruz but a lot of people in the
Intel community very concerned that Ted

230
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,939
Cruz is close to the RAM paul Vance a
traditional republican on issues of

231
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,30
Intel whether it's in assay data
collection you think Ted Cruz's too weak

232
00:18:15,30 --> 00:18:19,570
on national security i didnt watching
this little debate between Rubio and

233
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,260
crews that I'd love to because I haven't
been so involved it's the one thing I

234
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,600
haven't been involved can you believe it
I'd love to watch it and they seem to be

235
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,219
attacking themselves are strongly
because somebody wants to be standing to

236
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,180
challenge because of the snow brought up
though do you think the NSA should have

237
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,10
the ability to collect all the data that
it was able to before

238
00:18:41,10 --> 00:18:46,50
on the side of security sure you don't
get very interesting issue but I

239
00:18:46,50 --> 00:18:49,220
happened to be and I i've been there
from the beginning I've been there from

240
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,10
before the paris attack you don't have
to have attacked everybody says exactly

241
00:18:53,10 --> 00:18:59,50
this but I err on the side of security
on the side of security you know every

242
00:18:59,50 --> 00:19:02,419
time I pick up the phone I assume people
are listening to my conversations I

243
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,110
don't like it but I have to make that
assumption I would really much on the

244
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,310
side of security

245
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,879
a lot of people would agree with me and
it just to go back to the beginning of

246
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,370
the Syrian button this do you think
there's any chance that video you think

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,899
you saw in Jersey City was the video of
people in the West Bank Palestinian

248
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,190
celebrating and I get to bring it up
again well it's so wonderful that you

249
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,320
brought it up again

250
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,658
just this is why you can't get away from
the subject of senate talking about

251
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:30,70
things that are what we did

252
00:19:30,70 --> 00:19:37,000
15 minutes television fourteen years ago
sorta television it was written about

253
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,779
even though the reporter that says he
know me that I just don't know and he

254
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,179
may know me but I don't know him but
that's ok but the reporter wrote a

255
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,799
paragraph that he tried to pull back
from ok and the washington post ok

256
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,710
forget that I have received and as I
told you I have received of corals and

257
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:05,29
tweets from people find something to
find something but don't forget fourteen

258
00:20:05,29 --> 00:20:09,139
fifteen years ago was it like it is
today we present but then you play video

259

put it in files a destroyer put the

260
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,899
stuff you know if you look back fourteen
fifteen years eighteen times in terms of

261
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:22,289
in terms of cinema and in terms of news
and everything else it would have to say

262
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,830
today you can press a button you can see
exactly what went on

263
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,860
you know two years ago when you go back
to 14 15 years that's like ancient

technology show we get all the newscasts
