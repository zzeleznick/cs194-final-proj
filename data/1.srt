00:00:00 --> 00:00:10
Thank you. Thank you So Much. Thank you. Thank
you so much. Madam Chairwoman, thank you so

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
much for your kind words and your leadership.
To Prime Minister Hailemariam, and the people

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:23
of Ethiopia -- once again, thank you for your
wonderful hospitality and for hosting this

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:31
pan-African institution. (Applause.) To members
of the African Union, distinguished guests,

6
00:00:31 --> 00:00:39
ladies and gentlemen -- thank you for welcoming
me here today. It is a great honor to be the

7
00:00:39 --> 00:00:46
first President of the United States to address
the African Union. (Applause.)

8
00:00:46 --> 00:00:52
I’m grateful for this opportunity to speak
to the representatives of more than one billion

9
00:00:52 --> 00:01:00
people of the great African continent. (Applause.)
We’re joined today by citizens, by leaders

10
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
of civil society, by faith communities, and
I’m especially pleased to see so many young

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:11
people who embody the energy and optimism
of today’s Africa. Hello! Thank you for

12
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
being here. (Applause.)

13
00:01:14 --> 00:01:28
I stand before you as a proud American. I
also stand before you as the son of an African.

14
00:01:28 --> 00:01:37
(Applause.) Africa and its people helped to
shape America and allowed it to become the

15
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
great nation that it is. And Africa and its
people have helped shape who I am and how

16
00:01:42 --> 00:01:49
I see the world. In the villages in Kenya
where my father was born, I learned of my

17
00:01:49 --> 00:01:56
ancestors, and the life of my grandfather,
the dreams of my father, the bonds of family

18
00:01:56 --> 00:02:01
that connect us all as Africans and Americans.

19
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
As parents, Michelle and I want to make sure
that our two daughters know their heritage

20
00:02:06 --> 00:02:14
-- European and African, in all of its strengths
and all of its struggle. So we’ve taken

21
00:02:14 --> 00:02:21
our daughters and stood with them on the shores
of West Africa, in those doors of no return,

22
00:02:21 --> 00:02:28
mindful that their ancestors were both slaves
and slave owners. We’ve stood with them

23
00:02:28 --> 00:02:34
in that small cell on Robben Island where
Madiba showed the world that, no matter the

24
00:02:34 --> 00:02:45
nature of his physical confinement, he alone
was the master of his fate. (Applause.) For

25
00:02:45 --> 00:02:54
us, for our children, Africa and its people
teach us a powerful lesson -- that we must

26
00:02:54 --> 00:03:00
uphold the inherent dignity of every human
being.

27
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
Dignity -- that basic idea that by virtue
of our common humanity, no matter where we

28
00:03:06 --> 00:03:15
come from, or what we look like, we are all
born equal, touched by the grace of God. (Applause.)

29
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
Every person has worth. Every person matters.
Every person deserves to be treated with decency

30
00:03:21 --> 00:03:31
and respect. Throughout much of history, mankind
did not see this. Dignity was seen as a virtue

31
00:03:31 --> 00:03:41
reserved to those of rank and privilege, kings
and elders. It took a revolution of the spirit,

32
00:03:41 --> 00:03:48
over many centuries, to open our eyes to the
dignity of every person. And around the world,

33
00:03:48 --> 00:03:55
generations have struggled to put this idea
into practice in laws and in institutions.

34
00:03:55 --> 00:04:05
So, too, here in Africa. This is the cradle
of humanity, and ancient African kingdoms

35
00:04:05 --> 00:04:14
were home to great libraries and universities.
But the evil of slavery took root not only

36
00:04:14 --> 00:04:22
abroad, but here on the continent. Colonialism
skewed Africa’s economy and robbed people

37
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
of their capacity to shape their own destiny.
Eventually, liberation movements grew. And

38
00:04:29 --> 00:04:36
50 years ago, in a great burst of self-determination,
Africans rejoiced as foreign flags came down

39
00:04:36 --> 00:04:45
and your national flags went up. (Applause.)
As South Africa’s Albert Luthuli said at

40
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
the time, “the basis for peace and brotherhood
in Africa is being restored by the resurrection

41
00:04:50 --> 00:04:57
of national sovereignty and independence,
of equality and the dignity of man.”

42
00:04:57 --> 00:05:06
A half-century into this independence era,
it is long past time to put aside old stereotypes

43
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
of an Africa forever mired in poverty and
conflict. The world must recognize Africa’s

44
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
extraordinary progress. Today, Africa is one
of the fastest-growing regions in the world.

45
00:05:16 --> 00:05:23
Africa’s middle class is projected to grow
to more than one billion consumers. (Applause.)

46
00:05:23 --> 00:05:31
With hundreds of millions of mobile phones,
surging access to the Internet, Africans are

47
00:05:31 --> 00:05:40
beginning to leapfrog old technologies into
new prosperity. Africa is on the move, a new

48
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
Africa is emerging.

49
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
Propelled by this progress, and in partnership
with the world, Africa has achieved historic

50
00:05:48 --> 00:05:56
gains in health. The rate of new HIV/AIDS
infections has plummeted. African mothers

51
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
are more likely to survive childbirth and
have healthy babies. Deaths from malaria have

52
00:06:02 --> 00:06:09
been slashed, saving the lives of millions
of African children. Millions have been lifted

53
00:06:09 --> 00:06:16
from extreme poverty. Africa has led the world
in sending more children to school. In other

54
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
words, more and more African men, women and
children are living with dignity and with

55
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
hope. (Applause.)

56
00:06:24 --> 00:06:30
And Africa’s progress can also be seen in
the institutions that bring us together today.

57
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
When I first came to Sub-Saharan Africa as
a President, I said that Africa doesn’t

58
00:06:35 --> 00:06:43
need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.
(Applause.) And one of those institutions

59
00:06:43 --> 00:06:48
can be the African Union. Here, you can come
together, with a shared commitment to human

60
00:06:48 --> 00:06:54
dignity and development. Here, your 54 nations
pursue a common vision of an “integrated,

61
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
prosperous and peaceful Africa.”

62
00:06:58 --> 00:07:06
As Africa changes, I’ve called on the world
to change its approach to Africa. (Applause.)

63
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
So many Africans have told me, we don’t
want just aid, we want trade that fuels progress.

64
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
We don’t want patrons, we want partners
who help us build our own capacity to grow.

65
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
(Applause.) We don’t want the indignity
of dependence, we want to make our own choices

66
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
and determine our own future.

67
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
As President, I’ve worked to transform America’s
relationship with Africa -- so that we’re

68
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
truly listening to our African friends and
working together, as equal partners. And I’m

69
00:07:35 --> 00:07:42
proud of the progress that we’ve made. We’ve
boosted American exports to this region, part

70
00:07:42 --> 00:07:47
of trade that supports jobs for Africans and
Americans. To sustain our momentum -- and

71
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
with the bipartisan support of some of the
outstanding members of Congress who are here

72
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
today -- 20 of them who are here today -- I
recently signed the 10-year renewal of the

73
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
African Growth and Opportunity Act. (Applause.)
And I want to thank them all. Why don&#39;t they

74
00:07:59 --> 00:08:09
stand very briefly so you can see them, because
they’ve done outstanding work. (Applause.)

75
00:08:09 --> 00:08:17
We’ve launched major initiatives to promote
food security, and public health and access

76
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
to electricity, and to prepare the next generation
of African leaders and entrepreneurs --investments

77
00:08:23 --> 00:08:31
that will help fuel Africa’s rise for decades
to come. Last year, as the Chairwoman noted,

78
00:08:31 --> 00:08:35
I welcomed nearly 50 African presidents and
prime ministers to Washington so we could

79
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
begin a new chapter of cooperation. And by
coming to the African Union today, I’m looking

80
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
to build on that commitment.

81
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
I believe Africa’s rise is not just important
for Africa, it&#39;s important to the entire world.

82
00:08:48 --> 00:08:53
We will not be able to meet the challenges
of our time -- from ensuring a strong global

83
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
economy to facing down violent extremism,
to combating climate change, to ending hunger

84
00:08:58 --> 00:09:05
and extreme poverty -- without the voices
and contributions of one billion Africans.

85
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
(Applause.)

86
00:09:07 --> 00:09:16
Now, even with Africa’s impressive progress,
we must acknowledge that many of these gains

87
00:09:16 --> 00:09:23
rest on a fragile foundation. Alongside new
wealth, hundreds of millions of Africans still

88
00:09:23 --> 00:09:31
endure extreme poverty. Alongside high-tech
hubs of innovation, many Africans are crowded

89
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
into shantytowns without power or running
water -- a level of poverty that’s an assault

90
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
on human dignity.

91
00:09:37 --> 00:09:43
Moreover, as the youngest and fastest-growing
continent, Africa’s population in the coming

92
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
decades will double to some two billion people,
and many of them will be young, under 18.

93
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
Now, on the one hand, this could bring tremendous
opportunities as these young Africans harness

94
00:09:54 --> 00:10:03
new technologies and ignite new growth and
reforms. Economists will tell you that countries,

95
00:10:03 --> 00:10:10
regions, continents grow faster with younger
populations. It&#39;s a demographic edge and advantage

96
00:10:10 --> 00:10:19
-- but only if those young people are being
trained. We need only to look at the Middle

97
00:10:19 --> 00:10:26
East and North Africa to see that large numbers
of young people with no jobs and stifled voices

98
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
can fuel instability and disorder.

99
00:10:30 --> 00:10:37
I suggest to you that the most urgent task
facing Africa today and for decades ahead

100
00:10:37 --> 00:10:49
is to create opportunity for this next generation.
(Applause.) And this will be an enormous undertaking.

101
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
Africa will need to generate millions more
jobs than it’s doing right now. And time

102
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
is of the essence. The choices made today
will shape the trajectory of Africa, and therefore,

103
00:11:01 --> 00:11:09
the world for decades to come. And as your
partner and your friend, allow me to suggest

104
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
several ways that we can meet this challenge
together.

105
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
Africa’s progress will depend on unleashing
economic growth -- not just for the few at

106
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
the top, but for the many, because an essential
element of dignity is being able to live a

107
00:11:24 --> 00:11:34
decent life. (Applause.) That begins with
a job. And that requires trade and investment.

108
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
Many of your nations have made important reforms
to attract investment -- it’s been a spark

109
00:11:38 --> 00:11:47
for growth. But in many places across Africa,
it’s still too hard to start a venture,

110
00:11:47 --> 00:11:52
still too hard to build a business. Governments
that take additional reforms to make doing

111
00:11:52 --> 00:11:59
business easier will have an eager partner
in the United States. (Applause.)

112
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
And that includes reforms to help Africa trade
more with itself -- as the Chairwoman and

113
00:12:04 --> 00:12:09
I discussed before we came out here today
-- because the biggest markets for your goods

114
00:12:09 --> 00:12:15
are often right next door. You don&#39;t have
to just look overseas for growth, you can

115
00:12:15 --> 00:12:22
look internally. And our work to help Africa
modernize customs and border crossings started

116
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
with the East African Community -- now we’re
expanding our efforts across the continent,

117
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
because it shouldn’t be harder for African
countries to trade with each other than it

118
00:12:29 --> 00:12:34
is for you to trade with Europe and America.
(Applause.)

119
00:12:34 --> 00:12:42
Now, most U.S. trade with the region is with
just three countries -- South Africa, Nigeria

120
00:12:42 --> 00:12:49
and Angola -- and much of that is in the form
of energy. I want Africans and Americans doing

121
00:12:49 --> 00:12:54
more business together in more sectors, in
more countries. So we’re increasing trade

122
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
missions to places like Tanzania, Ethiopia
Mozambique. We’re working to help more Africans

123
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
get their goods to market. Next year, we’ll
host another U.S.-Africa Business Forum to

124
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
mobilize billions of dollars in new trade
and investment -- so we’re buying more of

125
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
each other’s products and all growing together.

126
00:13:12 --> 00:13:18
Now, the United States isn’t the only country
that sees your growth as an opportunity. And

127
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
that is a good thing. When more countries
invest responsibly in Africa, it creates more

128
00:13:24 --> 00:13:31
jobs and prosperity for us all. So I want
to encourage everybody to do business with

129
00:13:31 --> 00:13:39
Africa, and African countries should want
to do business with every country. But economic

130
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
relationships can’t simply be about building
countries’ infrastructure with foreign labor

131
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
or extracting Africa’s natural resources.
Real economic partnerships have to be a good

132
00:13:50 --> 00:13:57
deal for Africa -- they have to create jobs
and capacity for Africans. (Applause.)

133
00:13:57 --> 00:14:05
And that includes the point that Chairwoman
Zuma made about illicit flows with multinationals

134
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
-- which is one of the reasons that we&#39;ve
been a leading advocate, working with the

135
00:14:09 --> 00:14:16
G7, to assist in making sure that there’s
honest accounting when businesses are investing

136
00:14:16 --> 00:14:21
here in Africa, and making sure that capital
flows are properly accounted for. That&#39;s the

137
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
kind of partnership America offers.

138
00:14:24 --> 00:14:32
Nothing will unlock Africa’s economic potential
more than ending the cancer of corruption.

139
00:14:32 --> 00:14:37
(Applause.) And you are right that it is not
just a problem of Africa, it is a problem

140
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
of those who do business with Africa. It is
not unique to Africa -- corruption exists

141
00:14:42 --> 00:14:48
all over the world, including in the United
States. But here in Africa, corruption drains

142
00:14:48 --> 00:14:53
billions of dollars from economies that can&#39;t
afford to lose billions of dollars -- that&#39;s

143
00:14:53 --> 00:14:59
money that could be used to create jobs and
build hospitals and schools. And when someone

144
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
has to pay a bribe just to start a business
or go to school, or get an official to do

145
00:15:04 --> 00:15:10
the job they’re supposed to be doing anyway
-- that’s not “the African way.” (Applause.)

146
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
It undermines the dignity of the people you
represent.

147
00:15:16 --> 00:15:23
Only Africans can end corruption in their
countries. As African governments commit to

148
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
taking action, the United States will work
with you to combat illicit financing, and

149
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
promote good governance and transparency and
rule of law. And we already have strong laws

150
00:15:31 --> 00:15:39
in place that say to U.S. companies, you can&#39;t
engage in bribery to try to get business -- which

151
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
not all countries have. And we actually enforce
it and police it.

152
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
And let me add that criminal networks are
both fueling corruption and threatening Africa’s

153
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
precious wildlife -- and with it, the tourism
that many African economies count on. So America

154
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
also stands with you in the fight against
wildlife trafficking. That&#39;s something that

155
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
has to be addressed. (Applause.)

156
00:16:02 --> 00:16:10
But, ultimately, the most powerful antidote
to the old ways of doing things is this new

157
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
generation of African youth. History shows
that the nations that do best are the ones

158
00:16:16 --> 00:16:25
that invest in the education of their people.
(Applause.) You see, in this information age,

159
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
jobs can flow anywhere, and they typically
will flow to where workers are literate and

160
00:16:31 --> 00:16:36
highly skilled and online. And Africa’s
young people are ready to compete. I&#39;ve met

161
00:16:36 --> 00:16:44
them -- they are hungry, they are eager. They’re
willing to work hard. So we&#39;ve got to invest

162
00:16:44 --> 00:16:52
in them. As Africa invests in education, our
entrepreneurship programs are helping innovators

163
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
start new businesses and create jobs right
here in Africa. And the men and women in our

164
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
Young African Leaders Initiative today will
be the leaders who can transform business

165
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
and civil society and governments tomorrow.

166
00:17:04 --> 00:17:11
Africa’s progress will depend on development
that truly lifts countries from poverty to

167
00:17:11 --> 00:17:22
prosperity -- because people everywhere deserve
the dignity of a life free from want. A child

168
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26
born in Africa today is just as equal and
just as worthy as a child born in Asia or

169
00:17:26 --> 00:17:32
Europe or America. At the recent development
conference here in Addis, African leadership

170
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
helped forge a new global compact for financing
that fuels development. And under the AU’s

171
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
leadership, the voice of a united Africa will
help shape the world’s next set of development

172
00:17:42 --> 00:17:49
goals, and you’re pursuing a vision of the
future that you want for Africa.

173
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
And America’s approach to development -- the
central focus of our engagement with Africa

174
00:17:53 --> 00:18:00
-- is focused on helping you build your own
capacity to realize that vision. Instead of

175
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
just shipping food aid to Africa, we’ve
helped more than two million farmers use new

176
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
techniques to boost their yields, feed more
people, reduce hunger. With our new alliance

177
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
of government and the private sector investing
billions of dollars in African agriculture,

178
00:18:14 --> 00:18:20
I believe we can achieve our goal and lift
50 million Africans from poverty.

179
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
Instead of just sending aid to build power
plants, our Power Africa initiative is mobilizing

180
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
billions of dollars in investments from governments
and businesses to reduce the number of Africans

181
00:18:28 --> 00:18:33
living without electricity. Now, an undertaking
of this magnitude will not be quick. It will

182
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
take many years. But working together, I believe
we can bring electricity to more than 60 million

183
00:18:38 --> 00:18:46
African homes and businesses and connect more
Africans to the global economy. (Applause.)

184
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
Instead of just telling Africa, you’re on
your own, in dealing with climate change,

185
00:18:50 --> 00:18:55
we’re delivering new tools and financing
to more than 40 African nations to help them

186
00:18:55 --> 00:19:03
prepare and adapt. By harnessing the wind
and sun, your vast geothermal energy and rivers

187
00:19:03 --> 00:19:09
for hydropower, you can turn this climate
threat into an economic opportunity. And I

188
00:19:09 --> 00:19:14
urge Africa to join us in rejecting old divides
between North and South so we can forge a

189
00:19:14 --> 00:19:19
strong global climate agreement this year
in Paris. Because sparing some of the world’s

190
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
poorest people from rising seas, more intense
droughts, shortages of water and food is a

191
00:19:25 --> 00:19:30
matter of survival and a matter of human dignity.

192
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
Instead of just sending medicine, we’re
investing in better treatments and helping

193
00:19:34 --> 00:19:41
Africa prevent and treat diseases. As the
United States continues to provide billions

194
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
of dollars in the fight against HIV/AIDS,
and as your countries take greater ownership

195
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
of health programs, we’re moving toward
a historic accomplishment -- the first AIDS-free

196
00:19:52 --> 00:20:01
generation. (Applause.) And if the world learned
anything from Ebola, it’s that the best

197
00:20:01 --> 00:20:06
way to prevent epidemics is to build strong
public health systems that stop diseases from

198
00:20:06 --> 00:20:11
spreading in the first place. So America is
proud to partner with the AU and African countries

199
00:20:11 --> 00:20:17
in this mission. Today, I can announce that
of the $1 billion that the United States is

200
00:20:17 --> 00:20:27
devoting to this work globally, half will
support efforts here in Africa. (Applause.)

201
00:20:27 --> 00:20:34
I believe Africa’s progress will also depend
on democracy, because Africans, like people

202
00:20:34 --> 00:20:44
everywhere, deserve the dignity of being in
control of their own lives. (Applause.) We

203
00:20:44 --> 00:20:51
all know what the ingredients of real democracy
are. They include free and fair elections,

204
00:20:51 --> 00:20:58
but also freedom of speech and the press,
freedom of assembly. These rights are universal.

205
00:20:58 --> 00:21:07
They’re written into African constitutions.
(Applause.) The African Charter on Human and

206
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
Peoples Rights declares that “every individual
shall have the right to the respect of the

207
00:21:12 --> 00:21:21
dignity inherent in a human being.” From
Sierra Leone, Ghana, Benin, to Botswana, Namibia,

208
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
South Africa, democracy has taken root. In
Nigeria, more than 28 million voters bravely

209
00:21:27 --> 00:21:36
cast their ballots and power transferred as
it should -- peacefully. (Applause.)

210
00:21:36 --> 00:21:45
Yet at this very moment, these same freedoms
are denied to many Africans. And I have to

211
00:21:45 --> 00:22:02
proclaim, democracy is not just formal elections.
(Applause.) When journalists are put behind

212
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
bars for doing their jobs, or activists are
threatened as governments crack down on civil

213
00:22:08 --> 00:22:17
society -- (applause) -- then you may have
democracy in name, but not in substance. (Applause.)

214
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
And I&#39;m convinced that nations cannot realize
the full promise of independence until they

215
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
fully protect the rights of their people.

216
00:22:27 --> 00:22:34
And this is true even for countries that have
made important democratic progress. As I indicated

217
00:22:34 --> 00:22:42
during my visit to Kenya, the remarkable gains
that country has made with a new constitution,

218
00:22:42 --> 00:22:50
with its election, cannot be jeopardized by
restrictions on civil society. Likewise, our

219
00:22:50 --> 00:22:56
host, Ethiopians have much to be proud of
-- I&#39;ve been amazed at all the wonderful work

220
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
that&#39;s being done here -- and it&#39;s true that
the elections that took place here occurred

221
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
without violence. But as I discussed with
Prime Minister Hailemariam, that’s just

222
00:23:04 --> 00:23:09
the start of democracy. I believe Ethiopia
will not fully unleash the potential of its

223
00:23:09 --> 00:23:16
people if journalists are restricted or legitimate
opposition groups can&#39;t participate in the

224
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
campaign process. And, to his credit, the
Prime Minister acknowledged that more work

225
00:23:20 --> 00:23:29
will need to be done for Ethiopia to be a
full-fledged, sustainable democracy. (Applause.)

226
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
So these are conversations we have to have
as friends. Our American democracy is not

227
00:23:35 --> 00:23:46
perfect. We&#39;ve worked for many years -- (applause)
-- but one thing we do is we continually reexamine

228
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
to figure out how can we make our democracy
better. And that&#39;s a force of strength for

229
00:23:50 --> 00:23:58
us, being willing to look and see honestly
what we need to be doing to fulfill the promise

230
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
of our founding documents.

231
00:24:00 --> 00:24:08
And every country has to go through that process.
No country is perfect, but we have to be honest,

232
00:24:08 --> 00:24:17
and strive to expand freedoms, to broaden
democracy. The bottom line is that when citizens

233
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
cannot exercise their rights, the world has
a responsibility to speak out. And America

234
00:24:22 --> 00:24:27
will, even if it’s sometimes uncomfortable
-- (applause) -- even when it’s sometimes

235
00:24:27 --> 00:24:28
directed toward our friends.

236
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
And I know that there’s some countries that
don&#39;t say anything -- (laughter) -- and maybe

237
00:24:33 --> 00:24:40
that&#39;s easier for leaders to deal with. (Laughter.)
But you&#39;re kind of stuck with us -- this is

238
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
how we are. (Applause.) We believe in these
things and we&#39;re going to keep on talking

239
00:24:44 --> 00:24:44
about them.

240
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
And I want to repeat, we do this not because
we think our democracy is perfect, or we think

241
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
that every country has to follow precisely
our path. For more than two centuries since

242
00:24:53 --> 00:24:57
our independence, we’re still working on
perfecting our union. We&#39;re not immune from

243
00:24:57 --> 00:25:04
criticism. When we fall short of our ideals,
we strive to do better. (Applause.) But when

244
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
we speak out for our principles, at home and
abroad, we stay true to our values and we

245
00:25:10 --> 00:25:17
help lift up the lives of people beyond our
borders. And we think that&#39;s important. And

246
00:25:17 --> 00:25:22
it&#39;s especially important, I believe, for
those of us of African descent, because we&#39;ve

247
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28
known what it feels like to be on the receiving
end of injustice. We know what it means to

248
00:25:28 --> 00:25:35
be discriminated against. (Applause.) We know
what it means to be jailed. So how can we

249
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
stand by when it&#39;s happening to somebody else?

250
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
I&#39;ll be frank with you, it can&#39;t just be America
that&#39;s talking about these things. Fellow

251
00:25:43 --> 00:25:50
African countries have to talk about these
things. (Applause.) Just as other countries

252
00:25:50 --> 00:25:57
championed your break from colonialism, our
nations must all raise our voices when universal

253
00:25:57 --> 00:26:04
rights are being denied. For if we truly believe
that Africans are equal in dignity, then Africans

254
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
have an equal right to freedoms that are universal
-- that’s a principle we all have to defend.

255
00:26:09 --> 00:26:17
(Applause.) And it&#39;s not just a Western idea;
it&#39;s a human idea.

256
00:26:17 --> 00:26:24
I have to also say that Africa’s democratic
progress is also at risk when leaders refuse

257
00:26:24 --> 00:26:39
to step aside when their terms end. (Applause.)
Now, let me be honest with you -- I do not

258
00:26:39 --> 00:26:51
understand this. (Laughter.) I am in my second
term. It has been an extraordinary privilege

259
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
for me to serve as President of the United
States. I cannot imagine a greater honor or

260
00:26:55 --> 00:27:05
a more interesting job. I love my work. But
under our Constitution, I cannot run again.

261
00:27:05 --> 00:27:13
(Laughter and applause.) I can&#39;t run again.
I actually think I&#39;m a pretty good President

262
00:27:13 --> 00:27:15
-- I think if I ran I could win. (Laughter
and applause.) But I can&#39;t.

263
00:27:15 --> 00:27:34
So there’s a lot that I&#39;d like to do to
keep America moving, but the law is the law.

264
00:27:34 --> 00:27:43
(Applause.) And no one person is above the
law. Not even the President. (Applause.) And

265
00:27:43 --> 00:27:50
I&#39;ll be honest with you -- I’m looking forward
to life after being President. (Laughter.)

266
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
I won&#39;t have such a big security detail all
the time. (Laughter.) It means I can go take

267
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
a walk. I can spend time with my family. I
can find other ways to serve. I can visit

268
00:28:00 --> 00:28:13
Africa more often. (Applause.) The point is,
I don&#39;t understand why people want to stay

269
00:28:13 --> 00:28:26
so long. (Laughter.) Especially when they’ve
got a lot of money. (Laughter and applause.)

270
00:28:26 --> 00:28:38
When a leader tries to change the rules in
the middle of the game just to stay in office,

271
00:28:38 --> 00:28:49
it risks instability and strife -- as we’ve
seen in Burundi. (Applause.) And this is often

272
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
just a first step down a perilous path. And
sometimes you’ll hear leaders say, well,

273
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
I&#39;m the only person who can hold this nation
together. (Laughter.) If that&#39;s true, then

274
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
that leader has failed to truly build their
nation. (Applause.)

275
00:29:03 --> 00:29:11
You look at Nelson Mandela -- Madiba, like
George Washington, forged a lasting legacy

276
00:29:11 --> 00:29:14
not only because of what they did in office,
but because they were willing to leave office

277
00:29:14 --> 00:29:25
and transfer power peacefully. (Applause.)
And just as the African Union has condemned

278
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
coups and illegitimate transfers of power,
the AU’s authority and strong voice can

279
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
also help the people of Africa ensure that
their leaders abide by term limits and their

280
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
constitutions. (Applause.) Nobody should be
president for life.

281
00:29:39 --> 00:29:50
And your country is better off if you have
new blood and new ideas. (Applause.) I&#39;m still

282
00:29:50 --> 00:29:58
a pretty young man, but I know that somebody
with new energy and new insights will be good

283
00:29:58 --> 00:30:06
for my country. (Applause.) It will be good
for yours, too, in some cases.

284
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
Africa’s progress will also depend on security
and peace -- because an essential part of

285
00:30:11 --> 00:30:19
human dignity is being safe and free from
fear. In Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Sierra

286
00:30:19 --> 00:30:27
Leone, we’ve seen conflicts end and countries
work to rebuild. But from Somalia and Nigeria

287
00:30:27 --> 00:30:33
to Mali and Tunisia, terrorists continue to
target innocent civilians. Many of these groups

288
00:30:33 --> 00:30:38
claim the banner of religion, but hundreds
of millions of African Muslims know that Islam

289
00:30:38 --> 00:30:50
means peace. (Applause.) And we must call
groups
like al Qaeda, ISIL, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram

290
00:30:50 --> 00:30:58
-- we must call them what they are -- murderers.
(Applause.)

291
00:30:58 --> 00:31:03
In the face of threats, Africa -- and the
African Union --has shown leadership. Because

292
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
of the AU force in Somalia,
al-Shabaab controls less territory and the

293
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
Somali government is growing stronger. In
central Africa, the AU-led mission continues

294
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
to degrade the Lord’s Resistance Army. In
the Lake Chad Basin, forces from several nations

295
00:31:19 --> 00:31:24
-- with the backing of the AU -- are fighting
to end Boko Haram’s senseless brutality.

296
00:31:24 --> 00:31:28
And today, we salute all those who serve to
protect the innocent, including so many brave

297
00:31:28 --> 00:31:30
African peacekeepers.

298
00:31:30 --> 00:31:35
Now, as Africa stands against terror and conflict,
I want you to know that the United States

299
00:31:35 --> 00:31:41
stands with you. With training and support,
we’re helping African forces grow stronger.

300
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
The United States is supporting the AU’s
efforts to strengthen peacekeeping, and we’re

301
00:31:45 --> 00:31:49
working with countries in the region to deal
with emerging crises with the African Peacekeeping

302
00:31:49 --> 00:31:52
Rapid Response Partnership.

303
00:31:52 --> 00:31:56
The world must do more to help as well. This
fall at the United Nations, I will host a

304
00:31:56 --> 00:32:01
summit to secure new commitments to strengthen
international support for peacekeeping, including

305
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
here in Africa. And building on commitments
that originated here in the AU, we’ll work

306
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
to develop a new partnership between the U.N.
and the AU that can provide reliable support

307
00:32:11 --> 00:32:17
for AU peace operations. If African governments
and international partners step up with strong

308
00:32:17 --> 00:32:24
support, we can transform how we work together
to promote security and peace in Africa.

309
00:32:24 --> 00:32:27
Our efforts to ensure our shared security
must be matched by a commitment to improve

310
00:32:27 --> 00:32:33
governance. Those things are connected. Good
governance is one of the best weapons against

311
00:32:33 --> 00:32:38
terrorism and instability. Our fight against
terrorist groups, for example, will never

312
00:32:38 --> 00:32:45
be won if we fail to address legitimate grievances
that terrorists may try to exploit, if we

313
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
don’t build trust with all communities,
if we don’t uphold the rule of law. There’s

314
00:32:50 --> 00:32:54
a saying, and I believe it is true -- if we
sacrifice liberty in the name of security,

315
00:32:54 --> 00:32:59
we risk losing both. (Applause.)

316
00:32:59 --> 00:33:06
This same seriousness of purpose is needed
to end conflicts. In the Central African Republic,

317
00:33:06 --> 00:33:11
the spirit of dialogue recently shown by ordinary
citizens must be matched by leaders committed

318
00:33:11 --> 00:33:17
to inclusive elections and a peaceful transition.
In Mali, the comprehensive peace agreement

319
00:33:17 --> 00:33:22
must be fulfilled. And leaders in Sudan must
know their nation will never truly thrive

320
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
so long as they wage war against their own
people -- the world will not forget about

321
00:33:26 --> 00:33:26
Darfur.

322
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
In South Sudan, the joy of independence has
descended into the despair of violence. I

323
00:33:32 --> 00:33:44
was there at the United Nations when we held
up South Sudan as the promise of a new beginning.

324
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
And neither Mr. Kiir, nor Mr. Machar have
shown, so far, any interest in sparing their

325
00:33:48 --> 00:33:51
people from this suffering, or reaching a
political solution.

326
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
Yesterday, I met with leaders from this region.
We agree that, given the current situation,

327
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar must reach an agreement
by August 17th -- because if they do not,

328
00:34:03 --> 00:34:08
I believe the international community must
raise the costs of intransigence. And the

329
00:34:08 --> 00:34:12
world awaits the report of the AU Commission
of Inquiry, because accountability for atrocities

330
00:34:12 --> 00:34:21
must be part of any lasting peace in Africa’s
youngest nation. (Applause.)

331
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
And finally, Africa’s progress will depend
on upholding the human rights of all people

332
00:34:24 --> 00:34:33
-- for if each of us is to be treated with
dignity, each of us must be sure to also extend

333
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
that same dignity to others. As President,
I make it a point to meet with many of our

334
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
Young African Leaders. And one was a young
man from Senegal. He said something wonderful

335
00:34:43 --> 00:34:49
about being together with so many of his African
brothers and sisters. He said, “Here, I

336
00:34:49 --> 00:34:56
have met Africa, the [Africa] I’ve always
believed in. She’s beautiful. She’s young.

337
00:34:56 --> 00:35:03
She’s full of talent and motivation and
ambition.” I agree.

338
00:35:03 --> 00:35:08
Africa is the beautiful, talented daughters
who are just as capable as Africa’s sons.

339
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
(Applause.) And as a father, I believe that
my two daughters have to have the same chance

340
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
to pursue their dreams as anybody’s son
-- and that same thing holds true for girls

341
00:35:20 --> 00:35:25
here in Africa. (Applause.) Our girls have
to be treated the same.

342
00:35:25 --> 00:35:31
We can’t let old traditions stand in the
way. The march of history shows that we have

343
00:35:31 --> 00:35:37
the capacity to broaden our moral imaginations.
We come to see that some traditions are good

344
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
for us, they keep us grounded, but that, in
our modern world, other traditions set us

345
00:35:43 --> 00:35:52
back. When African girls are subjected to
the mutilation of their bodies, or forced

346
00:35:52 --> 00:35:59
into marriage at the ages of 9 or 10 or 11
-- that sets us back. That&#39;s not a good tradition.

347
00:35:59 --> 00:36:06
It needs to end. (Applause.)

348
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
When more than 80 percent of new HIV cases
in the hardest-hit countries are teenage girls,

349
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
that’s a tragedy; that sets us back. So
America is beginning a partnership with 10

350
00:36:17 --> 00:36:24
African countries -- Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,

351
00:36:24 --> 00:36:29
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- to keep teenage
girls safe and AIDS-free. (Applause.) And

352
00:36:29 --> 00:36:40
when girls cannot go to school and grow up
not knowing how to read or write -- that denies

353
00:36:40 --> 00:36:47
the world future women engineers, future women
doctors, future women business owners, future

354
00:36:47 --> 00:36:52
women presidents -- that sets us all back.
(Applause.) That&#39;s a bad tradition -- not

355
00:36:52 --> 00:36:57
providing our girls the same education as
our sons.

356
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
I was saying in Kenya, nobody would put out
a football team and then just play half the

357
00:37:01 --> 00:37:12
team. You’d lose. (Applause.) the same is
true when it comes to getting everybody and

358
00:37:12 --> 00:37:20
education. You can&#39;t leave half the team off
-- our young women. So as part of America’s

359
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
support for the education and the health of
our daughters, my wife, Michelle, is helping

360
00:37:24 --> 00:37:27
to lead a global campaign, including a new
effort in Tanzania and Malawi, with a simple

361
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
message -- Let Girls Learn -- let girls learn
so they grow up healthy and they grow up strong.

362
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
(Applause.) And that will be good for families.
And they will raise smart, healthy children,

363
00:37:37 --> 00:37:42
and that will be good for every one of your
nations.

364
00:37:42 --> 00:37:48
Africa is the beautiful, strong women that
these girls grow up to become. The single

365
00:37:48 --> 00:37:57
best indicator of whether a nation will succeed
is how it treats its women. (Applause.) When

366
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
women have health care and women have education,
families are stronger, communities are more

367
00:38:03 --> 00:38:10
prosperous, children do better in school,
nations are more prosperous. Look at the amazing

368
00:38:10 --> 00:38:19
African women here in this hall. (Applause.)
If you want your country to grow and succeed,

369
00:38:19 --> 00:38:23
you have to empower your women. And if you
want to empower more women, America will be

370
00:38:23 --> 00:38:30
your partner. (Applause.)
Let’s work together to stop sexual assault

371
00:38:30 --> 00:38:35
and domestic violence. Let’s make clear
that we will not tolerate rape as a weapon

372
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
of war -- it’s a crime. (Applause.) And
those who commit it must be punished. Let’s

373
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
lift up the next generation of women leaders
who can help fight injustice and forge peace

374
00:38:45 --> 00:38:53
and start new businesses and create jobs -- and
some might hire some men, too. (Laughter.)

375
00:38:53 --> 00:39:02
We’ll all be better off when women have
equal futures.

376
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
And Africa is the beautiful tapestry of your
cultures and ethnicities and races and religions.

377
00:39:06 --> 00:39:16
Last night, we saw this amazing dance troupe
made up of street children who had formed

378
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
a dance troupe and they performed for the
Prime Minister and myself. And there were

379
00:39:21 --> 00:39:26
80 different languages and I don&#39;t know how
many ethnic groups. And there were like 30

380
00:39:26 --> 00:39:29
different dances that were being done. And
the Prime Minister was trying to keep up with

381
00:39:29 --> 00:39:40
-- okay, I think that one is -- (laughter)
-- and they were moving fast. And that diversity

382
00:39:40 --> 00:39:46
here in Ethiopia is representative of diversity
all throughout Africa. (Applause.) And that&#39;s

383
00:39:46 --> 00:39:46
a strength.

384
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
Now, yesterday, I had the privilege to view
Lucy -- you may know Lucy -- she’s our ancestor,

385
00:39:52 --> 00:40:01
more than 3 million years old. (Applause.)
In this tree of humanity, with all of our

386
00:40:01 --> 00:40:09
branches and diversity, we all go back to
the same root. We’re all one family -- we&#39;re

387
00:40:09 --> 00:40:18
all one tribe. And yet so much of the suffering
in our world stems from our failure to remember

388
00:40:18 --> 00:40:24
that -- to not recognize ourselves in each
other. (Applause.)

389
00:40:24 --> 00:40:29
We think because somebody’s skin is slightly
different, or their hair is slightly different,

390
00:40:29 --> 00:40:37
or their religious faith is differently expressed,
or they speak a different language that it

391
00:40:37 --> 00:40:43
justifies somehow us treating them with less
dignity. And that becomes the source of so

392
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
many of our problems. And we think somehow
that we make ourselves better by putting other

393
00:40:47 --> 00:40:53
people down. And that becomes the source of
so many of our problems. When we begin to

394
00:40:53 --> 00:41:00
see other as somehow less than ourselves -- when
we succumb to these artificial divisions of

395
00:41:00 --> 00:41:08
faith or sect or tribe or ethnicity -- then
even the most awful abuses are justified in

396
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
the minds of those who are thinking in those
ways. And in the end, abusers lose their own

397
00:41:14 --> 00:41:21
humanity, as well. (Applause.)

398
00:41:21 --> 00:41:26
Nelson Mandela taught us, “to be free is
not merely to cast off one’s chains, but

399
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
to live in a way that respects and enhances
the freedom of others.”

400
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
Every one of us is equal. Every one of us
has worth. Every one of us matters. And when

401
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
we respect the freedom of others -- no matter
the color of their skin, or how they pray

402
00:41:38 --> 00:41:49
or who they are or who they love -- we are
all more free. (Applause.) Your dignity depends

403
00:41:49 --> 00:41:55
on my dignity, and my dignity depends on yours.
Imagine if everyone had that spirit in their

404
00:41:55 --> 00:42:04
hearts. Imagine if governments operated that
way. (Applause.) Just imagine what the world

405
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
could look like -- the future that we could
bequeath these young people.

406
00:42:08 --> 00:42:14
Yes, in our world, old thinking can be a stubborn
thing. That&#39;s one of the reasons why we need

407
00:42:14 --> 00:42:22
term limits -- old people think old ways.
And you can see my grey hair, I&#39;m getting

408
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
old. (Laughter.) The old ways can be stubborn.
But I believe the human heart is stronger.

409
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
I believe hearts can change. I believe minds
can open. That’s how change happens. That’s

410
00:42:33 --> 00:42:40
how societies move forward. It&#39;s not always
a straight line -- step by halting step -- sometimes

411
00:42:40 --> 00:42:45
you go forward, you move back a little bit.
But I believe we are marching, we are pointing

412
00:42:45 --> 00:42:48
towards ideals of justice and equality.

413
00:42:48 --> 00:42:54
That’s how your nations won independence
-- not just with rifles, but with principles

414
00:42:54 --> 00:42:58
and ideals. (Applause.) That&#39;s how African
Americans won our civil rights. That&#39;s how

415
00:42:58 --> 00:43:04
South Africans -- black and white -- tore
down apartheid. That&#39;s why I can stand before

416
00:43:04 --> 00:43:11
you today as the first African American President
of the United States. (Applause.)

417
00:43:11 --> 00:43:19
New thinking. Unleashing growth that creates
opportunity. Promoting development that lifts

418
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
all people out of poverty. Supporting democracy
that gives citizens their say. Advancing the

419
00:43:25 --> 00:43:32
security and justice that delivers peace.
Respecting the human rights of all people.

420
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
These are the keys to progress -- not just
in Africa, but around the world. And this

421
00:43:36 --> 00:43:37
is the work that we can do together.

422
00:43:37 --> 00:43:44
And I am hopeful. As I prepare to return home,
my thoughts are with that same young man from

423
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
Senegal, who said: Here, I have met Africa,
the [Africa] I’ve always believed in. She’s

424
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
beautiful and young, full of talent and motivation
and ambition. To which I would simply add,

425
00:43:54 --> 00:43:58
as you build the Africa you believe in, you
will have no better partner, no better friend

426
00:43:58 --> 00:44:00
than the United States of America. (Applause.)

427
00:44:00 --> 00:44:25
God bless Africa. God bless the United States
of America. Thank you very much, everybody.

428
00:44:25 --> 00:44:46
Thank you. (Applause.)
