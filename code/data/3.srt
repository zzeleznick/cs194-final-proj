1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,402
The President: There's been
another mass shooting in

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:07,440
America -- this time, in a
community college in Oregon.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,846
That means there are more
American families -- moms,

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:17,884
dads, children -- whose
lives have been changed forever.

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:22,021
That means there's another
community stunned with

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:26,426
grief, and communities
across the country forced to

7
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:30,997
relieve their own anguish,
and parents across the

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:35,335
country who are scared
because they know it might

9
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,371
have been their families
or their children.

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,610
I've been to
Roseburg, Oregon.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,612
There are really
good people there.

12
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,381
I want to thank all the
first responders whose

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,951
bravery likely saved
some lives today.

14
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,087
Federal law enforcement
has been on the scene in a

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,256
supporting role, and we've
offered to stay and help as

16
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:01,060
much as Roseburg needs,
for as long as they need.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,197
In the coming days, we'll
learn about the victims --

18
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,133
young men and women who were
studying and learning and

19
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:12,572
working hard, their eyes set
on the future, their dreams

20
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,542
on what they could
make of their lives.

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,111
And America will wrap
everyone who's grieving with

22
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,779
our prayers and our love.

23
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:25,785
But as I said just a few
months ago, and I said a few

24
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,992
months before that, and I
said each time we see one of

25
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,396
these mass shootings, our
thoughts and prayers are

26
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,364
not enough.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,303
It's not enough.

28
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:49,976
It does not capture the
heartache and grief and

29
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,312
anger that we should feel.

30
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,881
And it does nothing to
prevent this carnage from

31
00:01:54,881 --> 00:02:00,753
being inflicted someplace
else in America -- next

32
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,057
week, or a couple
of months from now.

33
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,997
We don't yet know why this
individual did what he did.

34
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:21,741
And it's fair to say that
anybody who does this has a

35
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:27,914
sickness in their minds,
regardless of what they

36
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,916
think their
motivations may be.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,223
But we are not the only
country on Earth that has

38
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:42,195
people with mental illnesses
or want to do harm to

39
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,898
other people.

40
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,934
We are the only advanced
country on Earth that sees

41
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,638
these kinds of mass
shootings every few months.

42
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,747
Earlier this year, I
answered a question in an

43
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,550
interview by saying, "The
United States of America is

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,121
the one advanced nation on
Earth in which we do not

45
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,392
have sufficient common-sense
gun-safety laws -- even in

46
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,962
the face of repeated
mass killings."

47
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,198
And later that day, there
was a mass shooting at a

48
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,935
movie theater in
Lafayette, Louisiana.

49
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,903
That day!

50
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,775
Somehow this has
become routine.

51
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,615
The reporting is routine.

52
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:41,721
My response here at this
podium ends up being routine.

53
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,024
The conversation in
the aftermath of it.

54
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,662
We've become numb to this.

55
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,899
We talked about this after
Columbine and Blacksburg,

56
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,970
after Tucson, after Newtown,
after Aurora,

57
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:57,971
after Charleston.

58
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:05,912
It cannot be this easy
for somebody who wants to

59
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,183
inflict harm on other people
to get his or her hands

60
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,184
on a gun.

61
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:17,090
And what's become routine,
of course, is the response

62
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,125
of those who oppose any
kind of common-sense

63
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,094
gun legislation.

64
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,965
Right now, I can imagine the
press releases being cranked

65
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,903
out: We need more
guns, they'll argue.

66
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,941
Fewer gun safety laws.

67
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,614
Does anybody really
believe that?

68
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,452
There are scores of
responsible gun owners in

69
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:50,256
this country --they
know that's not true.

70
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,792
We know because of the
polling that says the

71
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,927
majority of Americans
understand we should be

72
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,597
changing these laws --
including the majority of

73
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,766
responsible,
law-abiding gun owners.

74
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:07,774
There is a gun for roughly
every man, woman, and child

75
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,610
in America.

76
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,146
So how can you, with a
straight face, make the

77
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:17,583
argument that more guns
will make us safer?

78
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,489
We know that states with the
most gun laws tend to have

79
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,526
the fewest gun deaths.

80
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,663
So the notion that gun laws
don't work, or just will

81
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,833
make it harder for
law-abiding citizens and

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,436
criminals will still get
their guns is not borne out

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,438
by the evidence.

84
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,975
We know that other
countries, in response to

85
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:49,382
one mass shooting, have been
able to craft laws that

86
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,384
almost eliminate
mass shootings.

87
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,857
Friends of ours, allies
of ours -- Great Britain,

88
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,960
Australia,
countries like ours.

89
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,999
So we know there are
ways to prevent it.

90
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,872
And, of course, what's also
routine is that somebody,

91
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,143
somewhere will comment and
say, Obama politicized

92
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,145
this issue.

93
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,916
Well, this is something
we should politicize.

94
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,788
It is relevant to our common
life together, to the

95
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,790
body politic.

96
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,995
I would ask news
organizations -- because I

97
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,831
won't put these facts
forward -- have news

98
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,168
organizations tally up the
number of Americans who've

99
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,504
been killed through
terrorist attacks over the

100
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,874
last decade and the number
of Americans who've been

101
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:53,346
killed by gun violence, and
post those side-by-side on

102
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,047
your news reports.

103
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,049
This won't be information
coming from me; it will be

104
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,051
coming from you.

105
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,759
We spend over a trillion
dollars, and pass countless

106
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,530
laws, and devote entire
agencies to preventing

107
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,698
terrorist attacks on our
soil, and rightfully so.

108
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,473
And yet, we have a Congress
that explicitly blocks us

109
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:25,678
from even collecting data
on how we could potentially

110
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,680
reduce gun deaths.

111
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,417
How can that be?

112
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:43,095
This is a political choice
that we make to allow this

113
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:47,300
to happen every few
months in America.

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,037
We collectively are
answerable to those families

115
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,975
who lose their loved ones
because of our inaction.

116
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,048
When Americans are killed in
mine disasters, we work to

117
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,050
make mines safer.

118
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,019
When Americans are killed in
floods and hurricanes, we

119
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,021
make communities safer.

120
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:18,664
When roads are unsafe, we
fix them to reduce

121
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,633
auto fatalities.

122
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:26,038
We have seatbelt laws
because we know it saves lives.

123
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:33,012
So the notion that gun
violence is somehow

124
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:39,018
different, that our freedom
and our Constitution

125
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,293
prohibits any modest
regulation of how we use a

126
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:56,969
deadly weapon, when there
are law-abiding gun owners

127
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:01,574
all across the country who
could hunt and protect their

128
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,644
families and do everything
they do under such

129
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,548
regulations
doesn't make sense.

130
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:15,554
So, tonight, as those of us
who are lucky enough to hug

131
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:25,598
our kids a little closer are
thinking about the families

132
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,173
who aren't so fortunate, I'd
ask the American people to

133
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,809
think about how they can get
our government to change

134
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:44,750
these laws, and to save
lives, and to let young

135
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,752
people grow up.

136
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,922
And that will require a
change of politics on

137
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,923
this issue.

138
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,061
And it will require that
the American people,

139
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,030
individually, whether
you are a Democrat or a

140
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,801
Republican or an
independent, when you decide

141
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:07,006
to vote for somebody, are
making a determination as to

142
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:13,412
whether this cause of
continuing death for

143
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:17,316
innocent people should be
a relevant factor in

144
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,318
your decision.

145
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,456
If you think this is a
problem, then you should

146
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,458
expect your elected
officials to reflect

147
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,459
your views.

148
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,465
And I would particularly ask
America's gun owners -- who

149
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:42,008
are using those guns
properly, safely, to hunt,

150
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:53,285
for sport, for protecting
their families -- to think

151
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:56,522
about whether your views are
properly being represented

152
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:01,727
by the organization that
suggests it's speaking for you.

153
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,004
And each time this happens
I'm going to bring this up.

154
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,277
Each time this happens I am
going to say that we can

155
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,913
actually do something about
it, but we're going to have

156
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,915
to change our laws.

157
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,321
And this is not something
I can do by myself.

158
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,991
I've got to have a Congress
and I've got to have state

159
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:37,596
legislatures and governors
who are willing to work with

160
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,598
me on this.

161
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:49,175
I hope and pray that I don't
have to come out again

162
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,378
during my tenure as
President to offer my

163
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,547
condolences to families
in these circumstances.

164
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,151
But based on my experience
as President, I can't

165
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,153
guarantee that.

166
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,425
And that's terrible to say.

167
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,698
And it can change.

168
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,702
May God bless the memories
of those who were killed today.

169
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,573
May He bring comfort to
their families, and courage

170
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,075
to the injured as they
fight their way back.

171
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,481
And may He give us the
strength to come together

172
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:32,518
and find the
courage to change.

173
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:35,554
Thank you.
