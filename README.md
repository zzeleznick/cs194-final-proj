#  CS194-26: Video Supercuts (Website Branch)

## Project Summary:

### Dynamically creates a supercut from a video and subtitle pairing where the keyword(s) of interest are spoken

## Downloading

Due to the large file sizes of the data videos, we recommend that you create a parent directory with two separate folders to contain the 1) code and 2) website contents.

| Main Folder | Subfolders| Description |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
| supervid/   |           | home for video supercuts project |
|             |  code/    | directory for code base |
|             |  website  | directory for website  |

```
mkdir supervid && cd supervid
git clone -b gh-pages --single-branch https://github.com/zzeleznick/cs194-final-proj.git website
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/zzeleznick/cs194-final-proj.git code
```
